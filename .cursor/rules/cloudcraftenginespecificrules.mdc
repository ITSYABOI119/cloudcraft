description:# CloudCraft Engine Specific Rules

PROJECT CONTEXT:
This is a Minecraft server performance optimization plugin using Java 21 Virtual Threads.
The goal is REAL performance improvements through parallel entity processing.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Entity Processing MUST include:
   - Real AI logic (pathfinding, target selection)
   - Actual physics calculations
   - Working collision detection
   - Valid Bukkit API usage

2. Virtual Thread usage MUST:
   - Actually parallelize work
   - Include proper synchronization
   - Handle region transfers correctly
   - Measure real performance gains

3. Stress Testing MUST:
   - Spawn real Minecraft entities (not fake objects)
   - Measure actual server TPS
   - Process genuine workloads
   - Report honest metrics

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:
- Never write: // TODO
- Never write: // Implement later
- Never write: // Add logic here
- Never write empty method bodies
- Never claim performance without measurement

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Every optimization must be explained with CS principles
- Cache optimization must reference actual cache sizes
- Threading must handle race conditions
- All claims must be verifiable

EXAMPLE OF REQUIRED COMPLETENESS:
Instead of:
```java
public void processEntity(Entity e) {
    // TODO: Add processing
}
globs:
alwaysApply: true
