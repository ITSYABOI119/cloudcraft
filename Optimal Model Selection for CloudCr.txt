Cost-Effective Model Usage:
Daily Development Workflow:
Morning Deep Work (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):
java// Complex threading implementation
"Design and implement a lock-free entity region manager that:
- Handles 10,000+ entities efficiently
- Migrates entities between thread regions
- Maintains thread safety without blocking
- Integrates with Paper's event system"
Afternoon Iterations (Claude Regular/GPT-3.5):
java// Simpler tasks
"Add logging to this method"
"Generate getters/setters"
"Write unit tests for this class"
Documentation (GPT-4):
markdown"Generate comprehensive API documentation for this threading system"
"Create migration guide from Paper to CloudCraft"
Specific Model Strengths for Your Project:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet Excels At:

Java Virtual Threads (Project Loom)
JVM memory management
Concurrent data structures
Minecraft protocol knowledge
Complex refactoring

GPT-4 Excels At:

Generating diverse test scenarios
Creating documentation

Explaining code to others
Marketing content

When to Switch Models:
Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet when:

Working on core architecture
Debugging complex threading issues
Optimizing performance-critical paths
Implementing plugin compatibility

Switch to cheaper models when:

Writing tests (GPT-3.5)
Generating configs (Cursor-Fast)
Simple refactoring (Claude Regular)
Adding comments (Any model)

Pro Tips for Model Usage:
Context Management:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Feed entire classes + dependencies
GPT-4: Focus on specific methods
GPT-3.5: Small, isolated tasks
Prompt Engineering by Model:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Detailed):
java"Implement a thread-safe entity processor that:
Technical requirements:
- Uses Java 21 Virtual Threads
- Processes 10,000 entities in <50ms
- Lock-free where possible
- Graceful degradation under load

Include:
- Complete implementation
- Thread safety analysis
- Performance considerations
- Edge case handling"
GPT-4 (Structured):
"Generate 10 test cases for entity region migration:
1. Normal migration
2. Concurrent migrations
3. Border cases
4. Overload scenarios
..."
GPT-3.5 (Simple):
"Add debug logging to all public methods in this class"
Budget Optimization:
Monthly Model Budget Allocation:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $100 (core development)
GPT-4: $30 (documentation/testing)
Claude Regular: $20 (refactoring)
GPT-3.5: $10 (boilerplate)
Total: ~$160/month
ROI Maximization:

Each hour with Claude 3.5 Sonnet = 5-10 hours manual coding
Save GPT-4 for complex documentation (worth $500+ if done manually)
Use GPT-3.5 for repetitive tasks (10x faster than manual)

Model Selection for Specific CloudCraft Components:
yamlThreading Core: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Plugin API: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Event System: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Network Layer: GPT-4
Configuration: GPT-3.5
Documentation: GPT-4
Test Suite: GPT-4 + GPT-3.5
Benchmarks: GPT-4
Build Scripts: Claude Regular
Utilities: Cursor-Fast
The Bottom Line:
Start every complex task with Claude 3.5 Sonnet - it's worth the cost for architecture-critical code. Once you have the core structure, use cheaper models for expansion and refinement.
Your $160/month AI budget can generate $50,000+ worth of development work if used strategically. The key is knowing when to use the Ferrari (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and when the Honda Civic (GPT-3.5) will do just fine.
Remember: The model cost is negligible compared to the value of getting the architecture right the first time. Don't cheap out on core system design - use Claude 3.5 Sonnet and save money on everything else.
